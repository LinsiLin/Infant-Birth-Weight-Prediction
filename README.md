• Prediction of infant birth weight using 13 linear and non-linear regression algorithms such as Ridge and Lasso Regression, PCA, Bagging, and Boosting in a large dataset with  101,399 observations and 24 predictors.<br>
• Accurately predict infant birth weight with a mean square error within one pound.<br>
• Conducted model assumptions check for heteroscedasticity, collinearity, and skewness by statistical tests.<br>
• Illustrated variables significance on infant weight prediction.<br>
